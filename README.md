# DnD Digital Assistant Tools

> **A suite of automated utility scripts designed to streamline the Dungeon Master (DM) workflow for Tabletop RPGs.**

## Overview
Managing a Dungeons & Dragons campaign requires handling complex data tables, probability calculations, and narrative generation on the fly. **DnDTools** is a collection of Python scripts developed to automate these repetitive tasks, allowing the DM to focus on storytelling rather than table lookups.

This project serves as a playground for testing logic-based procedural generation combined with creative AI inputs.

## Features
* **Procedural Generation:** Algorithms to generate random encounters, loot tables, or NPC traits based on weighted probabilities.
* **DM Utilities:** Helper functions to calculate stats, dice rolls, and modifiers instantly.
* **Modular Architecture:** Designed as separate modules, making it easy to integrate into larger Unity or Web-based VTT (Virtual Tabletop) systems.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Concepts:** Probability & Statistics, Procedural Generation, OOP.

## Usage
Simply run the specific module you need:
```bash
python encounter_gen.py
